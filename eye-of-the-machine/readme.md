# Eye of the Machine (TIC-80)

The Machine awakens. Don't make direct eye contact!

## Overview

A dynamic, chaotic effect, using TTRI and VBANK to create a kaliedoscope and screen feedback effect that looks a bit like a cyber/organic eyeball.

It's a beast to tame. I don't think the version I entered hit the heights of some of the visuals I got when developing it... I got lost down the size-squeezing rabbit hole and lost sight of the result. Still, it's pretty close, and tinkering within this framework is very rewarding while you blast some music. I might release a Director's Cut if I find some good parameters again :)

## Play!

There are lots of numbers to mess around with in this one.

You could try:

- Changing the colour selection.
- Changing the way colour pixels are added to the kaliedoscope.
- Changing the way the kaliedoscope step size is chosen.
- Changing the size of the source texture triangle so that it maps onto the rendered triangle differently (affects how the colours bleed)
- Mixing in the amazing [TIC-80 FFT hack](https://github.com/glastonbridge/TIC-80/releases)

Beware: The video output is not very compression friendly, so it'll mash broadcast codecs and make large MP4 recordings, etc.

*DO* Get in touch and show me if you make anything! Contact details [here](https://github.com/creativenucleus/tic-80-sketches/blob/main/readme.md#contact)
