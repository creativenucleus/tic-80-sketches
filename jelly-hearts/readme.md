# Jelly Hearts

A sort of light-bend effect.

## Overview

This was crunched to <=256 bytes, but expanded again for clarity.

The technique I'm most pleased with is the compression of a [Lovebyte heart logo](https://lovebyte.party/). I tried a few different ways and this one shaved the most bytes.

The hearts whirl around screen, scaling up and down. The bigger they are, the further away the pixel they shift- so as they get closer to the viewer, they appear to have a bigger magnification effect.
