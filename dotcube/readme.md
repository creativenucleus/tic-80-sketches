# Dotcube (TIC-80)

FFT-enhanced colourful effect.

## Overview

This features a rotating dot cube with jazzy background (though it'll just be blank without music).

- The palette is split between the cube - brighter the closer it is - and the background.
- The background has a 'copper' style recolouring each scanline.
- There's a post-processing effect that dissolves some of the cube's pixels if they are further away.

Code hasn't been cleaned up for presentation, and probably won't be.

Ensure you run on the [TIC-80 with FFT hack](https://github.com/glastonbridge/TIC-80/releases), otherwise the `fft()` calls will not be recognised.
